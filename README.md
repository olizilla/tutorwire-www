Tutor Wire - Web Frontend
=========================

**An experiment in build time compilation of static html, with all the moving parts and dynamism powered by JS after page load**

Uses:
- [Handlebars] - Simple templating for pages, layouts and partials.
- [Assemble] - Merging all the htmls into a real website in _dist 
- [Bower] - Defining the front end, 3rd party, js lib dependencies in bower.json
- [Grunt] - The task runner that brings it all together with a `grunt`
